## 🚀 Project Overview

Numerology is an ancient system of interpretation that assigns meaning to numbers derived from letters and dates. This application makes numerology accessible by computing the **Life Path Number** — one of the most foundational values in numerological analysis — from simple user inputs.

**Goal:** Provide a standalone desktop utility that:
- Accepts a user’s name and date of birth
- Calculates their Life Path Number
- Displays numerological results in a clear graphical interface

**Platform:** Desktop (Windows / macOS / Linux)  
**Technology:** Java (Swing) GUI
